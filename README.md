DialogLab is a tool for configuring and running multi-agent conversations, with a React + Vite client and an Express server.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (client build and deploy scripts recommend Node 23)
- npm 8+

### Repository layout
- `client/`: React UI (Vite). Dev server on port 5173. Proxies API to the server.
- `server/`: Express API/Web server. Listens on port 3010.

### Quick start (development)
1) Install dependencies
- `cd client && npm install`
- `cd server && npm install`

2) Configure environment (server/.env)
Create a `.env` file in `server/` with the keys you intend to use. Example:
```
# Core
NODE_ENV=development

# LLM providers (choose one or both)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
API_KEY_LLM=your-openai-api-key

# Defaults (optional)
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini   # or openai
DEFAULT_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash

# Text-to-Speech (optional)
TTS_API_KEY=your-google-tts-api-key
TTS_ENDPOINT=https://eu-texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize
```

3) Run the server
```
cd server
node server.js
```
The server will start at `http://localhost:3010`.

4) Run the client
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
Open the client at `http://localhost:5173`.
